      <h2>The Series</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Teaching AI Ethics</em> series was created to give educators practical, accessible ways to discuss the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence across a wide range of subject areas. Rather than treating AI ethics as a topic for computer science classes alone, the series connects ethical questions to subjects students already study — from English and History to Visual Arts and Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally published in 2023, the series covers nine key areas of ethical concern:
      </p>
      <ul class="topics-list">
        <li><strong>Bias</strong> — How AI systems can reflect and amplify existing societal biases</li>
        <li><strong>Environment</strong> — The environmental costs of training and running AI models</li>
        <li><strong>Truth</strong> — Misinformation, deepfakes, and the challenge of distinguishing real from generated</li>
        <li><strong>Copyright</strong> — Questions of ownership, authorship, and creative rights in the age of generative AI</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy</strong> — How AI systems collect, store, and use personal data</li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> — The reduction of human experience to data points, and the scale of data collection in the GenAI era</li>
        <li><strong>Emotions</strong> — From affect recognition to social chatbots that manipulate human emotions</li>
        <li><strong>Human Labour</strong> — The hidden human work behind AI systems and the impact on employment</li>
        <li><strong>Power</strong> — Who controls AI development and deployment, and who benefits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In 2025&ndash;26, the series is being updated with new research, contemporary case studies, and additional teaching resources to reflect the rapid developments in AI since the original publication.
